#Vagrant
This is my Vagrant file that I use to create my box. My plan is to move all of
my VB tools over entirely to Vagrant so I can rebuild them when ever I feel the
need. This will continue to change as I add additional tools.

##To Do
1. ~~Add LanguageTool to .vim~~
2. ~~Add URLS to newsbeuter automatically~~
3. Add guake config file to .dotfiles and link correctly
